        I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Computing (Computer Science
        major) from the University of Sydney. In my final three semesters, I
        maintained a <strong className='text-light/90'>WAM above 80</strong>,
        demonstrating strong academic performance.

        I have a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and
        full-stack development, with a keen interest in system design, focusing
        on scalable, high performance, and resilient architectures. I enjoy
        building distributed systems that handle large-scale traffic efficiently
        while ensuring fault tolerance and optimised resource utilisation.
