        I recently completed a Bachelor of Computing with a major in Computer
        Science at the University of Sydney. During my studies, I built a solid
        foundation in algorithms, data structures, and full-stack development,
        consistently maintaining a WAM above 80 in the latter half of my course.

        I have a keen interest in both front-end and back-end development. I
        enjoy creating intuitive and engaging user interfaces while also
        designing scalable and resilient systems that can handle large-scale
        traffic efficiently. I'm particularly passionate about system design and
        distributed systems, focusing on solutions that ensure fault tolerance
        and make the most of available resources.

        Outside of academics, Iâ€™m driven by the challenge of solving complex
        engineering problems. I take pride in improving system performance and
        leveraging modern technologies to build practical, scalable applications
        that offer exceptional user experiences.
